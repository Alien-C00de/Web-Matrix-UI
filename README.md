# Web Matrix UI - Unveil the Secrets of the Website!

### Unveil the Secrets of Your Website: Secure, Analyze, Optimize.
- Web Matrix UI is a comprehensive tool and web application designed to uncover details about a website and provide users with a secure login experience.

- Users can now sign up and create accounts to access the platform.

- The web interface supports Dark & Light mode reports, offering a modern and user-friendly dashboard.

- The main idea is straightforward: provide a URL to the tool, and it will collect, organize, and display a wide range of open data for exploration.

- This data helps identify potential vulnerabilities in the website and optimize configurations. Further fine-tuning reduces the websiteâ€™s potential risks.

## Features
- Developed in **Python programming**.

- Built with **asynchronous programming**, allowing modules to run in parallel for faster results.

- Includes an **NMAP scan feature** â€” reports can be generated with or without the NMAP scan.

- Based on the output of each module, it calculates a percentage score for each module and an overall performance score. This is used to **display Website Health**.

- Now available as a **web application with authentication** (sign up & login).

- Supports **Dark & Light mode reports** for better accessibility and user experience.

- Currently, the HTML report **dashboard supports 30 modules**, with more features coming soon!
