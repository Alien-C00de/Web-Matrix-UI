# Web Kundli - Unveil the Secrets of the Website!

### Unveil the Secrets of Your Website: Secure, Analyze, Optimize.
- Web Kundli is a comprehensive tool designed to uncover details about a website.
- The main idea is straightforward: provide URL to the tool, and it will collect, organize, and display a wide range of open data for you to explore.
- This data helps identify potential vulnerabilities in the website and help optimizing its configurations. Further fine-tuning reduces the websiteâ€™s potential risks.

## Features
- This Tool is developed in **Python programming**.
- Developed using **asynchronous programming**, allowing modules to run in parallel and achieve faster results.
- The **NMAP scan feature** is also available. Reports can be generated with or without the NMAP scan.
- Based on the output of each module, it calculates the percentage for that module and then calculate the overall performance across all modules. This data is used to **display Website Health**.
- At present, the HTML report dashboard **supports 30 modules**. More features will be added soon!
